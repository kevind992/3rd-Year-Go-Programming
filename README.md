# My README to my solutions to the Go Problems

Go is a programming language created at Google
in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C,
with garbage collection, limited structural typing,
memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.
The compiler and other language tools originally developed by Google are all free
and open source. For more infomation on goland just visit the website.

To run the solutions to these 10 go programs you first need to download go onto your PC.
The Link below is the link to downloading go.

https://golang.org/dl/

Once go is on your PC you are ready to go.

Open your control prompt and navigate your way to where your the go progam is kept.

To build the program type "go build" followed by the name of the program followed by the file type.
This will create a "exe" file.
To run the file just simpley run the "exe" file and the program will run.

Each file solution is named by the filename. ex. Kon'nichiwa, Sekai! solution is name 
helloworld.go
Each solution has a commented code discribing what each solution is ment to do.
